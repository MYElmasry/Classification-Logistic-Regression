# Classification-Logistic-Regression
An implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch in python ðŸ“ˆ

## What Is Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression, despite its name, is a classification model rather than regression model. Logistic regression is a simple and more efficient method for binary and linear classification problems.
## Logistic Regression Steps
    1. Data Pre-processing step
    2. Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
    3. Predicting the test result
    4. Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)
    5. Visualizing the test set result.
## Repository Contents
This repository contains three examples for one feature Classification, one feature Classification with regularization and multivariable Classification and three datasets used in the previous examples.
